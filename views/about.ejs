                Please excuse the oddity of illusory hierarchy, this is just what gets the people going. My name is Fox Parton and I am the creator of this digital infrastructure web.

                I created this website to house my music and my projects which I think can bring light to the world and make people think (But not too hard) as they enjoy themselves. I believe in a better life for all
                and I am a passionate enthusiast for the rise of artifical intelligence - enabling more people to create, and to create faster and more ambitiously than ever before. Code, music, art, law, politics, are all becoming more accessible to each and every human regradless of their innate abilities.
                I believe this trend will continue to exponentiate until such a time as we are all truly equal - the machines and their output far dwarfing our own, and creativity becoming little more than a signature, like all other skills, a superpower of the past, now gifted to us all.
